# Cryptography Assignment
This assignment involves implementation of encryption and decryption of data using AES or RSA with the purpose of securely communicating between the client and the server.

## Requirements

Before you can run the code, you need to install the required packages. You can install them by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the Code
To run the code, you need to start the client and server in two different terminals.

In the first terminal, navigate to the folder where the client.py file is located and run the following command:
```bash
python client.py
```

In the second terminal, navigate to the folder where the server.py file is located and run the following command:
```bash
python server.py
```
With these two commands, the client and server should be running and communicating with each other securely through AES encryption and decryption.
